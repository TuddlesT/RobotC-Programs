All commented out code is for NXT controls. If you wish to use an NXT, simply uncomment that code and comment the EV3 controls. Note that controls will differ due to less buttons.
The size of the game is made for an NXT, so you will need to change the tileSize variable to fit the whole EV3 screen.
You can change the speed of the game by changing the speed variable located at the top of the file.
### Known bugs: ###
- Able to rotate out of game
- No check for being able to go in to placed blocks
